		why should I develop Key Word Driven frame work?
			 1. Few sensetive data to deal with
			 2. data are key and values pair
			 3. most of the case: you can not put values in the class file
			    because if you write on class file
			          it is tough to change values in the production
			               you must comple and push-- as a result server has to stop for hours
			   because if you write on properties file 
			        only refresh is enough-- server did not have to stop
